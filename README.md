# HueServer
### Inspiration
Having to either go through Alexa, Google home, or your phone sometimes can be a hassle when dealing with turning on and off your new Huge lightbulbs. What happened to traditional lightswitches? The idea is that using the aws programmable IOT button, you can customize actions and settings everytime you press the button. But this is still a hassle, this project allows you to set basic settings from a Messenger chatbot that will automatically update a database. Everytime you press a button, preferences are loaded in from the database and executed without any coding!
